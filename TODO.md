# TODO:

  [ ] Recreate the 22x22 and 24x24 `gpm-primary-000-charging` icons, but with the dark charging symbol instead (so they work on light themes as well)
  [ ] If we're going to do that, we ought to do the same for `-charged`
  [ ] https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-y-icons has some tools and the like that might be handy
  [ ] Fix `scalable-to-fixed.sh` to only create output for specific sizes (don't create PNGs for 22 and 24)
